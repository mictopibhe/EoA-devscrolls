## 🎮 Project Vision

Eclipse of Ages is a modern reimagining of the classic text-based MMORPG Combats, infused with the haunting beauty of Slavic mythology. Designed for Ukrainian and European players, this browser-based game brings back the addictive simplicity of early 2000s text-based RPGs while introducing fresh, immersive features.

What we’re building:

Nostalgic Text-Based Gameplay: Relive the thrill of Combats with turn-based battles, character progression, and clan rivalries, all driven by vivid text descriptions and strategic choices.

Slavic Mythology: Explore a world of ancient spirits like Leshy, Vodyanoy, and Baba Yaga, where every quest and encounter is steeped in folklore-inspired lore.

Modern Enhancements: Enjoy a sleek, mobile-friendly interface, real-time multiplayer interactions via WebSocket, and dynamic storytelling that adapts to player decisions.

Community Focus: Shape the game through feedback, with systems for guilds, trading, and player-driven events.

Eclipse of Ages is a love letter to the golden era of browser games, rekindled with mythic depth and modern polish for a new generation of adventurers.
