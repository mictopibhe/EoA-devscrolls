## 🌒 Welcome to Eclipse of Ages

Welcome to the first devlog of Eclipse of Ages, a text-based MMORPG that brings the nostalgic magic of Combats into a world steeped in Slavic mythology. 🌑 This game is our love letter to retro browser RPGs, reimagined for Ukrainian and European adventurers in 2025.

## The Spark

As lovers of Combats’ strategic text-based battles and Slavic folklore’s haunting tales, we’re building Eclipse of Ages to merge retro RPG charm with modern polish. This week, we gathered our starting team, laid the technical groundwork, and dreamed big about the game’s future. Here’s where it all begins!

## Core Concepts

Eclipse of Ages is built on a few key pillars that will shape its identity:

Text-Based RPG Core: Inspired by Combats, the game centers on strategic, turn-based text battles where players choose actions (attack, defend, use skills) to outwit foes. Character progression (stats, gear, skills) and clan systems foster competition and camaraderie.

Slavic Mythology Atmosphere: The game will immerse players in a world of Slavic folklore, with NPCs driving quests and conflicts. Expect morally complex choices and mythic narratives.

Dynamic Storytelling: Using Neo4j, we’re crafting adaptive dialogue trees that change based on player decisions, making every quest feel personal and replayable.

Modern Accessibility: A sleek, mobile-friendly Angular UI ensures the game is easy to play anywhere, with real-time multiplayer (via WebSocket) for clan battles and trading.

Community-Driven Evolution: From day one, we want player feedback to shape mechanics, lore, and features. Guilds, events, and leaderboards will thrive on community input.

These concepts blend the addictive simplicity of Combats with the depth of Slavic myths and the polish of modern tech, creating a game that feels both nostalgic and fresh.

## 🛠️ Early Steps

Early Steps

The first week was all about setting the stage for Eclipse of Ages:

Team Assembly: Brought together a passionate crew of developers, designers, and folklore enthusiasts. We kicked off with a session to share our love for Combats and brainstorm the game’s vibe.

Tech Stack Selection: Chose a modern, scalable stack to power the game:
Frontend: Angular for a responsive, mobile-friendly text UI.
Backend: Spring Boot (Kotlin) for robust and scalable game logic.
Database: PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Redis for caching.
Auth: OAuth for seamless Google/Facebook logins.
DevOps: Docker for consistent development environments.

Project Foundations:

Created a backend starter with Spring Boot, including initial REST endpoints for basic functionality
Bootstrapped a frontend starter with Angular.
Set up Jira with a Kanban board to organize tasks and streamline workflows.
Initialized a Figma project for UI/UX mockups, starting with rough sketches of interfaces.
Concept Discussions: Outlined the game’s direction, inspired by Combats’ turn-based battles, character progression, and clan systems, with a Slavic mythology twist. We’re aiming for dynamic quests and morally complex NPC interactions.

These steps mark the foundation of Eclipse of Ages, setting us up to prototype and iterate quickly.

## 🚧 What’s Next

With the foundation in place, here’s what we’re tackling next:

Login UI Design: Develop Figma mockups for the game’s login and registration page, aiming for a sleek, Slavic-inspired aesthetic that feels both mythic and user-friendly.

OAuth 2.0 Authentication: Implement login and registration logic using OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook, integrating with Spring Boot (backend) and Angular (frontend) to ensure secure and seamless onboarding.
