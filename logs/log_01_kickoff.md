## 🌒 Welcome to Eclipse of Ages

This marks the official kickoff of development for *Eclipse of Ages*, a browser-based MMORPG inspired by Slavic mythology, designed for Ukrainian and European audiences.

The idea was born out of nostalgia for early 2000s browser RPGs, and a desire to blend those mechanics with modern lore, combat, and UI experiences.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

- Slavic dark fantasy with strong PvP/PvE loops  
- Character progression rooted in myth, relics, and ancient powers  
- Dialogue-driven world state using a graph database  
- Designed to be accessible from any modern browser  
- Community-focused development with open devlogs

  ---

## 🛠️ Early Steps

At this stage, the focus was:
- Researching tech stack options (Angular / Spring Boot / Neo4j / Redis)
- Sketching the initial world lore and structure
- Setting up Jira for Kanban-style task tracking
- Planning out MVP systems: auth, character creation, combat, and exploration

  ---

## 🚧 Next Steps

- Begin implementing basic backend (auth + player DB)
- Set up Docker dev environment
- Design starter UI for landing and login
- Prototype first interactive systems (dialogue + character setup)

We're setting out on this long journey one line of code at a time. This devlog will capture it all — the progress, the missteps, the wins, and the passion behind *Eclipse of Ages*.

Stay tuned. 🌘
