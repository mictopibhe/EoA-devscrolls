## 💡 Design Notes

- **Kuny** serve as a soft onboarding tool and PvP reward motivator in early game.
- **Hryvni** form the backbone of the game's economy and support mid- to end-game systems.
- **Seals** are monetization-focused and intended to sustain the project while rewarding dedicated players.
- Currency separation maintains economy balance and prevents pay-to-win exploit loops.
